This lack of emotion does however allow them to stay calm and follow orders when most others would/could not.

Their digestive systems can eat meat that is completely rotten, and with the help of their almost completely degenerated noses they do not find the smell of rottenness unpleasant, but rather prefer the "heavy" smell. The fish genome allows them to move more swiftly in wet environments, and they can also store deadly rotten gases in their air sac organs and release them in battle. Their bodies and the deadly virus create a balance that allows them to inject toxins into their enemies with every attack, but once the rotfish dies, this balance is immediately broken and their bodies decay rapidly.."</td>
