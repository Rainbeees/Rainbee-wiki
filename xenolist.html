						<td>Dirtmoles love to be in dark places, the more cramped the better, and therefore thrive in close combat. Whilst they are extremely capable when it comes to mining or digging, they suffer from poor long-distance eyesight, have slow movement speed, and will have an adverse reaction to light.</td>

						<td>Genie</td>
						<td><img src="images/xenos/fgenie.png" alt="A rather tall and elongated humanoid called a Genie" ></td>
						<td>Genies are solely designed to be engineers. With their brains specifically hardwired to analyze and construct machinery, they are socially inept and emotionally void. This lack of emotion does however allow them to stay calm and follow orders when most others would/could not. They also suffer from weak bones and therefore can become debilitated with very little effort, from very little pain.</td>
						<td>Biotech DLC</td>

					<tr>
						<td>Hussar</td>
						<td><img src="images/xenos/fhussar.png" alt="A red eyed, thick bodied humanoid called a Hussar"></td>
						<td>Hussars are soldiers, through and through. They fight with aggression and precision that most others cannot achieve, have enhanced healing capabilities, can survive in extreme temperatures, and continually ingest military drugs. They consume these drugs so much they have a dependency on them, making them completely subservient to their commanders.</td>

						<td>The Neanderthals are strong and well-built; so much so that they are very difficult to injure. Furthermore, their immune systems are strong enough that they are resistant to infection. Much like real-world Neanderthals, however, these humans have yet to fully develop into a functioning society and therefore are weaker at intellectual and social tasks. They are also impulsive and quick to anger.</td>

Their trotter hands leave them disadvantaged when it comes to the precise use of tools, objects, or equipment, but their stomachs allow them to eat almost anything with no consequences. Struggling at a distance, the Pigskins tend to prefer close-range weaponry.</td>

						<td>Impids were made for desert life, with the ability to survive high temperatures, move incredibly fast, and spew fire from their mouths. As they are specifically designed for the desert, they will struggle to survive in most other environments, and furthermore have terrible abilities when it comes to farming. Capable fighters at range, the Impids will very easily lose a fight should it become a more close-quarters encounter.</td>

Their size and coating in fur allow them to be incredibly sturdy, at the cost of their speed, energy, and precision.

They grow tumors and use them to heal their friends. They are filthy creatures with poor social, medical and artistic skill. They don't feel pain and their lungs are immune to toxic waste. This can be dangerous for them as they have frail skin and get damaged easier. Their bodies seem to have adapted to heal a little faster.</td>
